Hello!

This entry will be fairly short. As you have probably already noticed, I have decided to ditch my old website a few months ago. Although I realize that it contained some valuable content, I believe that my posts from back then were poorly written (most notably, they contained way too much text in contrast to the amount of actual information) and the site itself used to have issues with being indexed by Google. Therefore, aside from further posts on some of my projects, you may expect that sooner or later I'm going to rewrite some of my older articles. In conclusion, you should expect a new entry in the upcoming month or so.

Thanks for reading and see you until next time!
