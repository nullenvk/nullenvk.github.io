# Hello! 

Welcome to my site! :D

This is a small blog dedicated to... well, pretty much anything that I may want to publish on the internet in a relatively permanent form. You should primarily expect posts about technology and my ongoing projects, but I may put some of my personal thoughts and rants here too.

You may also find me on:

- Github: [nullenvk](https://github.com/nullenvk)
